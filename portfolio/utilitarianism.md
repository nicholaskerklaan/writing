# Utilitarianism: A Brief Overview

All of us have had the experience of asking ourselves: "What's the right thing to do here?"

There are different ways to go about answering that question. One is to consider whether the action we might take is in line with certain principles or rules that
we think are worth following. For example, maybe I think it's important to always keep my word. In that case, I can rule out breaking promises; any time
I find myself having to choose between keeping a promise or breaking it, I can remind myself that I don't actually have a choice, not if I want to keep to
my principles.

Another way to answer the question, the one that utilitarians start from, is to ask what the *consequences* of any given action will be. In particular, we can
consider how different people, inclduing ourselves, will be affected by our actions. For a utilitarian, we should always strive to take actions that maximize
the positive effects on people while minimizing the negative effects.

## Act Utilitarianism

The easiest way to understand utilitarianism in more depth is to look at the simplest form of it. *Act utilitarianism* is a theory first proposed by Jeremy Bentham, and developed
by his protégé John Stuart Mill. The views of Bentham and Mill remain compelling to this day, and still set the blueprint for all utilitarian theories.

The basic idea of act utilitarianism is that for any of the possible actions I could take in a given situation, I ask myself how much good and bad it will produce among all the people it will
affect; "good" is usually understood here in terms of pleasure or happiness, and "bad" in terms of pain or suffering. I then try to calculate
the _net_ good produced by the action -- that is, all the good it produces minus all of the bad. Having done this for all my possible
actions, the right thing to do is whatever produces the most net good.

## Objections to Act Utilitarianism

One common criticism of act utilitarianism is that it's just not possible to exactly quantify good and bad like this, but even if it was it also wouldn't be
practical to sit down and do it for every action I _might_ take in a given situation.

Most utilitarians don't think this poses a real problem for the theory. While it may be practically impossible to exactly quantify good and bad, or to do an
extensive calculation of it whenever we think about acting, utilitarians argue that the theory still gives us a good overall picture of what it means to act morally. We *can* generally think through our main options and we *can* generally have a good idea of which of those is more likely to cause more good than bad for the most people.

A much stronger objection to act utilitarianism is that it potentially commits us to thinking some actions most people would find morally wrong are in fact the morally *right* thing to do. Consider the case of a town sheriff confronted by an angry mob, threatening to run riot and burn down the town if the woman they believe to be the local witch isn't executed. 

If the sheriff is a committed act utilitarian, then it seems like he should execute the woman. To execute an innocent person is bad, but weighed against the good of preventing the destruction of the town by a mob, it's still the best course of action.

It's harder for an act utilitarian to respond to this objection; they pretty much have to "bite the bullet" and accept that sometimes promoting overall good requires doing things that, from the perspective of any other moral framework, seem incredibly wrong.

## Rule Utilitarianism

There's a version of utilitarianism that isn't necessarily caught by that last objection; some utilitarians prefer it over act utilitarianism for that reason. It's called _rule utilitarianism_.
