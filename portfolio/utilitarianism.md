# Utilitarianism: A Brief Overview

All of us have had the experience of asking ourselves, "What's the right thing to do here?"

There are different ways to go about answering that question. One is to consider whether the action we're thinking of taking is in line with certain principles or rules that
we think are worth following. For example, maybe I think it's important to always keep your word. In that case, I can rule out breaking promises; any time
I find myself having to choose between keeping a promise or breaking it, I can remind myself that I don't actually have a choice, not if I want to keep to
my principles.

Another way to answer the question, the one that utilitarians start from, is to ask what the *consequences* of any given action will be. In particular, we often
consider how different people, inclduing ourselves, will be affected by our actions. For a utilitarian, we should always strive to take actions that maximize
the positive effects on people while minimizing the negative effects.

## Act Utilitarianism

The easiest way to understand utilitarianism in more depth is to look at the simplest form of it. *Act utilitarianism* is a theory first proposed by Jeremy Bentham, and developed
by his protégé John Stuart Mill. The views of Bentham and Mill remain compelling to this day, and still set the blueprint for all utilitarian theories.

The basic idea of act utilitarianism is that for any of the possible actions I could take in a given situation, I ask myself how much good and bad it will produce among all the people it will
affect; "good" is usually understood here in terms of pleasure or happiness, and "bad" in in terms of pain or suffering. I then try to calculate
the _net_ good produced by the action -- that is, all the good it produces minus all of the bad. Having done this for all my possible
actions, the right thing to do is whatever produces the most net good.

## Objections to Act Utilitarianism

One common criticism of act utilitarianism is that it's just not possible to exactly quantify good and bad like this, and that even if it was it's not practical
to sit down and do a bunch of calculations every time you want to make a decision.
