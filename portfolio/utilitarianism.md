# Utilitarianism: A Brief Overview

All of us have had the experience of asking ourselves, "What's the right thing to do here?"

There are different ways to go about answering that question. One is to ask if the action we're thinking of taking obeys certain principles or rules that
we think are worth following. Maybe I think it's important to always keep your word. In that case, I can rule out actions that involve, say, breaking
a promise.

Another way to answer the question, the one that utilitarians start from, is to ask what the *consequences* of any given action will be. For a utilitarian,
we should always strive to choose the course of action that will maximize good consequences while minimizing bad ones.
