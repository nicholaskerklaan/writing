# Utilitarianism: A Brief Overview

All of us have had the experience of asking ourselves, "What's the right thing to do here?"

There are different ways to go about answering that question. One is to ask if the action we're thinking of taking obeys certain principles or rules that
we think are worth following. Maybe I think it's important to always keep your word. In that case, I can rule out actions that involve, say, breaking
a promise.

Another way to answer the question, the one that utilitarians start from, is to ask what the *consequences* of any given action will be. For a utilitarian,
we should always strive to choose the course of action that will maximize good consequences while minimizing bad ones.

## Act Utilitarianism

The easiest way to understand utilitarianism is to look at the simplest form of it. *Act utilitarianism* is a theory first proposed by Jeremy Bentham, and developed
by his protégé John Stuart Mill. The views of Bentham and Mill remain compelling to this day, and still set the blueprint for all utilitarian theories.

The basic idea of act utilitarianism is that for any given action I couild take, I ask myself who that action is going to affect -- importantly, this includes
myself! All those affected could receive good feelings as a result of my action (pleasure, happiness), or bad feelings (pain, suffering).
