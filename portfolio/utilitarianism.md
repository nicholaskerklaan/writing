# Act vs. Rule Utilitarianism

## What is Utilitarianism?

Most of us have at some point faced situations that have made us ask, "What's the right thing to do?" And most of us have at some point had to justify
something we already did. It's easier to figure out the right thing to do, and easier to explain why we *thought* something was the right thing to do,
when we have some general idea of what we think makes actions right or wrong. We often talk about having certain principles that we follow, or a code.

Moral philosophers are interested in the same questions, but they tend to want to approach things more generally and systematically. Different philosophers
have provided different answers to the question of how to tell what the right thing to do is in any given situation.

*Utilitarianism* is the name of a moral theory that tries to provide one such answer, first proposed by Jeramy Bentham and then further developed by his protégé
John Stuart Mill. The basic idea of utilitarianism is that we should always strive to maximize what Bentham called *utility*, which we best think of
as positive consequences for people, and to minimize negative consequences for people like suffering.
