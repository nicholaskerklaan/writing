# Five Tips for Better Code Courtesy of The Zen of Python

In 1999 Tim Peters posted a set of 19 proposed guiding principles for the Python pgoramming language to the official Python mailing list. And if anyone would have a good idea of what some of those might be, it would be him -- as a software developer and major contributor to the Python language over the years, his thoughts are worth taking seriously.

The Python folks seemed to think so too. The post was eventually reproduced in its entirety as Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) 20, entitled "The Zen of Python." PEPs are documents where new features of the Python language, or useful information for Python programmers to know, are shared with the wider Python community. The Zen of Python is an example of the former, and it's been widely-shared and discussed within the community ever since.

In lieu of listing all 19 principles, here's just five that seem especially applicable not just to Python, but any coding. Think of them as a set of broadly applicable best practices.
