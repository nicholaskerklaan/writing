# 10 Epic Fantasy Series for Fans of _The Stormlight Archive_

With the release of *Wind and Truth* late last year, Brandon Sanderson's beloved epic fantasy series, *The Stormlight Archives*, slowly but surely moves itself forward. 

Sanderson is nothing if not prolific, and even as he works on multiple other projects the waiting time between *Stormlight* books has remained consistent. Still, it _is_ going to be a bit before the next one comes out, so if you're all caught up why not check out some other fantaasy series with a similar sense of epic scope and massive worldbuilding?

Within that framework, there's room for a Cosmere's worth of tones and writing styles, so there should be something for everyone on this list.

There's a good chance many *Stormlight Archive* fans have already read this classic epic fantasy series, since Brandon Sanderson himself wrote the last three books, working from Robert Jordan's notes, after the author passed in 2007.
