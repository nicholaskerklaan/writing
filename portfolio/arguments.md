# What is an Argument?

## The Basics

In an everyday sense, we talk about "arguments" in different ways. Perhaps most commonly, we mean a disagreement or fight, whether serious
or not so serious. Maybe you argued with your spouse about money, or with your friends about where to eat dinner.

An "argument" can also mean a reason given to support some position, and that's generally what philosophers mean by the word. Specifically, they tend to think of 
arguments as consisting of one or more _premises_ in support of some _conclusion_. The conclusion is a claim about what is the case, or maybe about what _should_
be the case. The premises are _why_ you ought to believe the conclusion.

## An Example

Philosophers tend to be interested in certain kinds of arguments: about ethics, the nature of knowledge, and so on. They also have developed some formal, math-like ways to express arguments. But arguments can be about anythinmg, and we can also easily express them in plain, everyday language. Here's an argument:

***Premise 1:*** Socrates is a man.

***Premise 2:*** All men are mortal.

***Conclusion:*** Socrates is mortal.

There's a lot we could say about this argument. It's a commom example in philosophy classrooms and textbooks, because it illustrates a specific form Aristotle called a "syllogism." But four our purposes, it's enough to recognize that we have: (1) a claim the argument has staked itself to, the conclusion that Socrates is mortal; and (2) two premises which, taken together, are meant to convince us of the truth of the conclusion.

## Evaluating Arguments

Take the above argument about Socrates. *How* are its premises meant to convince us of the truth of its conclusion? Well, let's look at them a little closer.

Premise 1 states that Socrates is a man. Premise 2 states that all men are mortal. If both of those statements are true, wouldn't we be forced to conclude that Socrates, a man, is mortal, like all men are? It certainly seems so!

Philosophers call this kind of argument, where the conclusion must be true if all the premises are true, *valid*. In calling an argument valid, we aren't saying its conclusion *is* true, just that the premises have the right kind of relationship to the conclusion. Here's an invalid argument:

***Premise 1:*** My dog's name is Luna.

***Premise 2:*** Portugal is in Europe.

***Conclusion:*** The sky is blue.

See the difference? Whether or not it's true that my dog's name is Luna or that Portugal is in Europe has absolutely no bearing on whether or not the sky is blue. In this case, the premises and conclusion are all true, but the argument remains invalid.

If an argument is both valid and all the premises are true, philosophers call it *sound*. To see how an argument could be valid but not sound, we can look at one more example:

***Premise 1:*** If Portugal is in North America, then the moon is made of cheese.

***Premise 2:*** Portugual is in North America.

***Conclusion:*** The moon is made of cheese.

Just like the Socrates argument, the very way in which we've phrased the premises means the conclusion would be true if the premises were all true. But, of course, the premises are not true, and neither is the conclusion. So the argument is valid but not sound.

This is just one kind of argument, what philosophers call a *deductive argument*. There's a whole other important class of arguemnts, *inductive arguments*, which we evaluate a bit differently. Still, many of the arguments philosophers work with, or indeed that we encounter in our everyday lives, look something like the above.
