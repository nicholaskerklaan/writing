# What is an Argument?

In an everyday sense, we talk about "arguments" in different ways. Perhaps most commonly, we mean a disagreement or fight, whether serious
or not so serious. Maybe you argued with your spouse about money, or with your friends about where to eat dinner.

An "argument" can also mean a reason given to support some position, and that's generally what philosophers mean by the word. Specifically, they tend to think of 
arguments as consisting of one or more _premises_ in support of some _conclusion_. The conclusion is a claim about what is the case, or maybe about what _should_
be the case. The premises are _why_ you ought to believe the conclusion.
