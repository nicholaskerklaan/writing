# What is an Argument?

## The Basics

In an everyday sense, we talk about "arguments" in different ways. Perhaps most commonly, we mean a disagreement or fight, whether serious
or not so serious. Maybe you argued with your spouse about money, or with your friends about where to eat dinner.

An "argument" can also mean a reason given to support some position, and that's generally what philosophers mean by the word. Specifically, they tend to think of 
arguments as consisting of one or more _premises_ in support of some _conclusion_. The conclusion is a claim about what is the case, or maybe about what _should_
be the case. The premises are _why_ you ought to believe the conclusion.

Philosophers tend to be interested in certain kinds of arguments -- about ethics, the nature of knowledge, and so on. They also have developed some formal, math-like ways to express arguments. But arguments can be about anythinmg, and we can also easily express them in plain, everyday language. Here's an argument:

***Premise 1:*** Socrates is a man.

***Premise 2:*** All men are mortal.

***Conclusion:*** Socrates is mortal.

There's a lot we could say about this argument. It's a commom example in philosophy classrooms and textbooks, because it illustrates a specific form Aristotle called a "syllogism." But four our purposes, it's enough to recognize that we have a claim the argument has staked itself too, the conclusion that Socrates is mortal, and then two premises which, taken together, are meant to convince us of the truth of the conclusion.
