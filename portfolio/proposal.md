# Research Proposal

## Previous and Current Studies

I am currently in my third year of doctoral studies in philosophy at the University of Calgary.
Over my first two years in the program I have completed all of my course requirements,
successfully completed my Field of Study examinations, and successfully defended a dissertation
proposal. The remainder of my time in the program will be spent researching and writing the
dissertation itself. I intend to complete and defend the
dissertation within four years from my entering the program. I am also currently working on
learning Classical Greek, which I intend to have at the level needed to consult original texts in
finalizing the dissertation.

I hold a Master of Arts in philosophy from Concordia University in Montreal. My MA thesis,
completed under the supervision of Dr. Emilia Angelova, offered a close reading of the
*Meditations* of Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Stoic philosopher and emperor, in the context of
20th century French philosopher Michel Foucault’s own reading of Marcus Aurelius as representative of
Hellenistic and Roman practices of ethical self-transformation through writing. 

## Context and Objective of Research

My proposed doctoral research centers on Plato’s *Theaetetus*. In this dialogue, Plato has three
characters -- Socrates, the mathematician Theodorus, and Theaetetus, a promising young student
of Theodorus -- attempt to define knowledge. As such, the dialogue has traditionally been treated
as a work of epistemology. However, there are sections of the dialogue which do not seem to
center the question of knowledge, at least not straightforwardly, but rather concern issues relating
to what it means to be a philosopher or to philosophize.

My research focuses on this aspect of the dialogue. Tentatively, my broad thesis is that this
dialogue is at least as much about the nature of philosophy and the philosopher as it is about the
nature of knowledge, and I aim to demonstrate this through a close textual commentary that
foregrounds these issues, as well as draws connections to relevant secondary literature.

## Methodology

My approach to interpreting Plato is in keeping with a growing number of scholars who
emphasize the importance of his use of the dialogue form. To put it briefly, these scholars argue
that because Plato writes dialogues (particularly literarily rich and complex
dialogues at that), and not treatises, we must assume that all aspects of these texts are potentially
philosophically relevant -- or, at the very least, we must not assume from the outset the sharp
distinction between “philosophical” and “literary” elements in the dialogues that traditional
interpretive approaches have often made.

Given this approach, my reading of the *Theaetetus* covers both elements of the dialogue explicitly concerned with the nature of philosophy, and other elements which, I argue, _implicitly_ touch on these issues without necessarily making direct arguments or claims. To very briefly summarize, the two sections of the dialogue which most obviously fall
into the former category are: Socrates’ description of his philosophical activity as a kind of
“midwifery of the soul”; and the section commonly referred to as
“the digression,” in which the discussion of knowledge is briefly interrupted for a discussion of
what distinguishes the philosopher from the average politically and practically-oriented Greek
citizen.

One example which belongs to the implicit category is the dialogue’s opening frame. The
discussion between the three men is presented in the frame as a written account made by another
man from a different city, many years after Socrates’ death, who was not actually present for the
conversation but had it recounted to him by Socrates. In framing the dialogue in this way, Plato
seems to intentionally highlight not only the temporal and spatial distance between the event and
its recounting, but the difference between philosophy as a lived, conversational activity, the way
it is presented in the dialogue, and its written presentation in the very dialogue itself.

## Contribution

As noted, the traditional interpretation of the *Theaetetus* is that it is a dialogue first and
foremost about knowledge. This has led some scholars to dismiss sections like the digression as,
to quote Gilbert Ryle, “totally irrelevant to the topic of the dialogue” (1966, 278). Even when
scholars take such elements seriously the focus is often on how their relevance to the topic of
knowledge can be explained, even if they acknowledge, as e.g. Myles Burnyeat (1990, 31-39)
does, that something like the digression is philosophically interesting and important in its own
right.

My main contribution to Plato studies will be to provide an alternative to this traditional reading
of the dialogue that, I believe, remains truer to the text as it actually is: if it repeatedly touches,
both directly and indirectly, on issues of the nature of philosophy and philosophers, then it would
seem reasonable to conclude that this is, in addition to being a dialogue about knowledge, a
dialogue about philosophy.

In offering this alternative reading, I also hope, as a secondary goal, to contribute to the
secondary literature on Plato’s methodology and conception of philosophy. Much of this
literature centers on dialogues which are taken to much more explicitly treat such questions: the
*Phaedrus*, the *Republic*, and to some extent the *Apology*. Considering the *Theaetetus* in this
context will, I hope, allow for new insights and a fresh perspective on issues concerning, to put it
very broadly and simply, what Plato thinks a philosopher is, what we do when we philosophize,
and how his dialogues function as his own method of philosophizing.
