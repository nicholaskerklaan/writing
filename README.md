# Content Writing

Here you can read some samples of my content writing. They are all short articles (600-800 words) that aim to provide interesting and/or helpful information while emphasizing certain keywords for SEO (search engine optimization).

These articles cover several different topics, which call for different kinds and levels of research, as well as slightly different tones (more casual for pop culture, more serious or straightforward for tech and business).

In writing these articles for specific clients, I would likely include a call to action (to explore more of the client's website, to purchase something, etc.), and possibly hyperlinks within the article to other pages the client might want to direct readers toward. Specific details of formatting and style would also be informed by the client's needs.
