# Nicholas Kerklaan's Writing Portfolio

I have a PhD in philosophy so I know how to take complex ideas and break them down in writing for different audiences, and how to persuade and inspire readers.

Here you can read some samples of my writing, across several different categories.

## Content Writing

These are articles which could be published as blog posts or website content, with the goal of being helpful and informative while emphasizing certain keywords for search engine optimization (SEO).

## Philosophical Writing

These are short non-academic articles, each of which break down a philosophical concept for a general audience.

## Proposal Writing

This is a proposal I wrote as part of applying for grant funding, where the goal was to explain my research and its importance to an educated but non-specialist audience.
